# Documentation interpretation principles

<a name="doc1"></a>doc1: It is possible to misapply any non-trivial principle
----

When using a documented principle written in a human language, focus on its
_general intent_ rather than on the literal interpretation of isolated words.
If applying a principle leads to an absurd conclusion, then, most likely, the
wrong principle was applied or the right principle was applied incorrectly.
Try again or, if at a loss, respectfully discuss the conundrum before jumping
to conclusions.


<a name="doc2"></a>doc2: There are no absolute principles
----

It is impossible to document everything in a human-driven process. There are
always gray areas and exceptions. If you believe that an important case must
be treated specially, please state so explicitly and explain why you feel that
way.
