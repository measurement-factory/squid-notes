### Documentation interpretation principles

<a name="p1"></a>**p1**: It is possible to misapply any non-trivial principle written in English. When using a documented principle, focus on its _general intent_ rather than on the literal interpretation of isolated words.

<a name="p2"></a>**p2**: There are no absolute principles. It is impossible to document everything in a human-driven process. There are always gray areas and exceptions. If you believe that an important case must be treated specially, please state so explicitly and explain why you feel that way.
